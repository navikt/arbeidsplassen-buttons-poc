CSS Styleguide PoC

To check out the examples simply go to the desired framwork's folder and run the app as stated in the README.md.

If your framework is not available here, you can still try the styles by installing the npm package.
```
npm install @navikt/arbeidsplassen-buttons-poc
```

Once the library is installed simply make use of the classes to style your buttons.

- `Button--primary` 
- `Button--secondary`
- `Button--tertiary`
- `Button--disabled` (will require the `disabled` html attribute)
